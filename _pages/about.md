## About Me!
<center><img src ="https://github.com/dunhamc13/dunhamc13.github.io/blob/master/IMG_5120.jpg?raw=true" class="half"></center>  
<p class="indented">I am a dynamic leader and team maker with 15 years of professional experience. My diverse background melds one of a kind Special Forces leadership with customer-centric retail experience and software engineering.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">As a former Special Forces Detachment Commander, I have unique knowledge in thinking like the 'hacker' demonstrated in the physical domain. I spent years looking at the architecture of combatant armies and societal structures through the lens of the guerrilla identifying weak points, gathering information to develop attack vectors. During my transition to the civilian world, I spent time in the retail sector, learning how to be obsessed with the end-to-end customer experience. Now, my past and present skills are forging a career in cybersecurity. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">My strengths include planning, leading, team building, design, problem-solving, and achieving outcomes.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="indented">My soft skills include unique leadership experience, time-sensitive planning, cross-cultural team building, customer segmentation, and red team planning and execution in the physical domain.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="indented">Technical Skills include C++, C#, Java, Python, OOP, ADT, Microsoft, VIM/VI, Visual Studio, Eclipse, MAC OS, Windows, Linux.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">I am passionate about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</p>
<p class="indented">The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was the predecessor for both the Central Intelligence Agency and Special Forces. Before the Army employed segregation to keep women out of combat roles, female operators were part of the OSS throughout WWII.  This perpetuated stereotypes, myths, and discrimination that I witnessed throughout my career.  My team participated in the pilot program, Cultural Support Teams (CST), in 2013.  The CST program was the precursor to the first female being allowed to complete the Special Forces Qualification Course in 2020.  I championed this program in the face of adversity.  However, the difficulty I faced was nothing compared to the discrimination and challenges bore by the brave women of the CST program.  I am proud to have played a small role in righting a social injustice.  </p>

<p class="indented">My interest includes offensive security, penetration testing, fuzzing, and vulnerability assessments.  I love identifying a problem and working to develop a solution with a team.  </p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">I am most proud of my son, who helped me plan and build our first computer together.  We conducted a hasty requirements engineering to ensure we built a home lab capable of supporting ethical targeting. I continue to marry my unique past in physical security with my future in the cyber domain.  He is still upset that I'm not using my 2080 TI for gaming...  </p>
