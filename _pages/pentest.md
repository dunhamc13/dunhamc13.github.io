## Designing and Building a home pentesting labratory

<p class="indented">One of the key things I have learned is that experiential learning is the necessary component to press new skills to become great skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">In order to meld the soft skills of my past with my new technical skills I need to create an ethical environment to gain experience.  Those soft skills from my past include an inquisitive mindset, willingness to try and to fail, infrastructure analysis, modeling, and thinking like the attacker.  </p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">Those soft skills have now been paired with Information Assurance, Network Systems Security, Machine Learning, Technical Writing, Computer Networking, Secure Software Development, and Software Testing and Quality.  However, I needed an environment in which I could better explore the networking stack in order to become a better security engineer.</p>

<p class="indented">I enlisted the help of my then 12 year old son.  Taking off the heat plates to instal M2 hard drives to support two operating systems, Windows 10 and Kali Linux.  Each operating system back up with clones and images.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="indented">Technical Skills include C++, C#, Java, Python, OOP, ADT, Microsoft, VIM/VI, Visual Studio, Eclipse, MAC OS, Windows, Linux.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">I am passionate about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.</p>
<p class="indented">The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was the predecessor for both the Central Intelligence Agency and Special Forces. Before the Army employed segregation to keep women out of combat roles, female operators were part of the OSS throughout WWII.  This perpetuated stereotypes, myths, and discrimination that I witnessed throughout my career.  My team participated in the pilot program, Cultural Support Teams (CST), in 2013.  The CST program was the precursor to the first female being allowed to complete the Special Forces Qualification Course in 2020.  I championed this program in the face of adversity.  However, the difficulty I faced was nothing compared to the discrimination and challenges bore by the brave women of the CST program.  I am proud to have played a small role in righting a social injustice.  </p>

<p class="indented">My interest includes offensive security, penetration testing, fuzzing, and vulnerability assessments.  I love identifying a problem and working to develop a solution with a team.  </p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">I am most proud of my son, who helped me plan and build our first computer together.  We conducted a hasty requirements engineering to ensure we built a home lab capable of supporting ethical targeting. I continue to marry my unique past in physical security with my future in the cyber domain.  He is still upset that I'm not using my 2080 TI for gaming...  </p>
