## How to use social media to detect the signal from noise!  Predicting Violent Uprisings with Machine Learning // UNDER CONSTRUCTION

<p class="indented">This project, Signal From Noise (SFN), explores Special Forces Doctrine and social media as features to predict the use of violence to overthrow a government. SFN aims to produce a higher level of accuracy in contrast to traditional approaches that have focused their features on social and economic sciences.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">SFN is a machine
of machines. Thus far in the initial Design the hate feature has been implemented.  The machine has a ’day’ object see Figure 1: Day Object. Each day object has seven features. Those features are machines in their own right. The seven features are: hate speech, disinformation, disenfranchisement, LE/ME, organizing, political sentiment, and political attacks. The values of those features will be used to conduct the final model to predict a UW event.  </p>
<p></p>
<p class="indented">To reverse engineer our features, we begin at the bottom of that figure. The base of the pyramid begins with measures of dissatis- faction. That dissatisfaction is aimed at political, economic, and social conditions. This base could be read as Political Sentiment and scraped from social media. As we move up the base we see elements of Disinformation with propaganda and lies. Again, this can be measured through social media data scrapes. To expedite this iterative process, elements of Disenfranchisement, LE/MIL infil- tration, Organizing, and Political Attacks all increase as we move up the figure towards the overt UW thresh hold represented with a dashed line.</p>

<p class="indented">One of the neat features of the program was creating a feature that presents a word blob of the words that are hate.</p>

<p class="indented">Designing the project was fun.  I tried to make sure the hardware would support network model simulations.</p>
