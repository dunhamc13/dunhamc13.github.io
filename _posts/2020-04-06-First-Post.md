# Welcome
**Thanks for stopping by!**

This is my first blog post.

I am trying to get back to my old front end roots!  Please check out my about me!  In 2004 I graduated from the University of Illinois with a B.S in information technology studies and a B.A. in English / Rhetoric.  While the fortran crowd can call me an infant, I am still amazed to look back at my transicripts from the time that didn't have any better way to describe classes that focused on website development, user experience, http 1.0, XML, and databases as 'ADV TOP' in information technology.  

However, I admit, being in school from 2000-2004 I was part of the post .com bubble that celebrated and sold everything that had a website with market valuations that were not attached to reality.  Since that time I have served a 9 year military career and am currently working my way through a M.S. in Cybersecurity Engineering.  In other terms, 20 years later I've decided to become a full stack!  

I look forward to sharing my thoughts along the way!
